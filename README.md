Flashing Micropython Firmware to ESP32 Board
-----------------------------------------------
Source code is available on Github, as a fork of MicroPython repo as ESP32 support has not been upstreamed yet. 
We could built the firmware from source, but thereâ€™s also a pre-built binary which you can download on MicroPython 
website.
